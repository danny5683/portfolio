<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>  <p>Born in Atlanta, raised too. I was born May 1, 2001 in south fulton medical, being the oddball off the house hold because i was the only one born there. I'm not sure why this taunts me so much. I'm now 16 years old & is an upcoming junior in high school. I decided to make this webpage to express my likes & dislikes, I believe my life is interesting enough. I dont want to get personal but you wouldn't understand me if i didnt soo, i went to north west youth power where i was "bullied" but not really because i wasnt scared & i fought back but i think that was their plan.Getting through prek wasn't really hard or a struggle the girls didnt intimidate me, or i never really cared about fitting in AT ALL. But i must admit have one friend was kind of good, plot twist the friend was a boy& thats why the girls hated me, but we were practically babies so it was weird that they hated me so much over somthing that kids shouldn't even be worried about. But kindergarden was better, i didnt realize how funny I was & everybody loved me, 1st through 5th grade were probably the BEST years of my life. Middle school was alright until 8th grade then my grades dropped, not drastically but enough for me to nice i was no longer on A & B honor role. High school, high school is by far THE WORST part of my life so far, maybe 11th & 12th grade would be better but based on what ive already been through its terrible, but enough about that, those were my school days, the good old days. 
   I dont think im a judgy person but i am picky, i like singing but i hate humming. I love food anything other than vegetables, I dont like anything green besides pickles, & anything red. I love to sing although im no whitney houston or Jazmine Sulivan i believe im pretty good. I'm picky on the way i talk, the way i walk,  & even the way i look. Its kind of funny because i started to hate the way i talk once i started my 10th grade year in high i dont know the actual cause but i know i hate it. I started to hate the way i walk the summer after 9th grade, i realized that its weird so i dont like it because im knock kneed, its not bad but its noticable by me so i hate it. I started to hate the way i look my 6th grade year, i wont go into detail but i am very insecure about myself.
