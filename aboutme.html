  <p>Born in Atlanta, raised too. I was born May 1, 2001 in south fulton medical, being the oddball off the house hold because i was the only one born there. I'm not sure why this taunts me so much. I'm now 16 years old & is an upcoming junior in high school. I decided to make this webpage to express my likes & dislikes, I believe my life is interesting enough.</p>


  
  
  </body>I dont think im a judgy person but i am picky, i like singing but i hate humming. I love food anything other than vegetables, I dont like anything green besides pickles, & anything red.
